# YM2149

The YM2149, also known as the Software-Controlled Sound Generator or SSG, is modified AY-3-8910 re-branded by Yamaha. The chip has twice the resolution as the original, but a double-rate volume envelope table. Pin 26 can be used to halve the master clock when pulled low. This chip was used by the MSX2, MSX2+, MSX TurboR, Atari ST, and an assortment of arcade games. It has several revisions, one of which is the YM2149F which was embedded in several other chips including the YM2203, YM2608, YM2610, and Sunsoft's 5B chip.
